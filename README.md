Source : [Please find the Dataset here](https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-property-sales-data)

## Overview

The House Price Prediction Model project aims to harness the power of machine learning to accurately forecast real estate prices. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors, this project seeks to develop a predictive model that can provide valuable insights for potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors.

The project will involve several key stages, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. Various machine learning algorithms will be explored and compared to identify the most effective approach for predicting house prices. The final model will be evaluated based on performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

In addition to building the predictive model, the project will also focus on the practical application of the model and strategies for deployment. The ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly tool that can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size and other relevant factors. This model aims to provide valuable insights for potential homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors by leveraging data-driven techniques to forecast property values. Additionally, the project seeks to explore and compare different machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for house price prediction, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in the predictions.
